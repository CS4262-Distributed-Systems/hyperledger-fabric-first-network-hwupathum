1. Proof of work concept
Proof of work is used by blockchain platforms like Bitcoin to solve double spending problem. It makes sure that the only a node which generates the nonce first will be able to add a new block to the blockchain. This requires a significant amount of processing power and the nodes will be rewarded as a compensation for their contribution.

2. Blockchain
Blockchain is a decentralized ledger, where records of all the transactions are stored. These are stored as a linked chain of blocks, which stores the hash of the previous block and other records. Hashing is used to prevent the modification of blocks in the chain.
